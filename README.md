## A simple word cloud generator which counts the number of words in the books

# Text of the books downloaded are downloaded from:
# A Mid Summer Night's Dream:
http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2242/pg2242.txt
# The Merchant of Venice:
http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2243/pg2243.txt
# Romeo and Juliet:
http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1112/pg1112.txt

# The application allows for the number of words to be counted and presented in WordCloud. Common words like 'the', 'thy','thee' etc are not counted

# The application could be further improved by adding an upload function to allow uploading of any text files.
